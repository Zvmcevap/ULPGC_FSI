# Image Classification for cats and dogs

Innitial dataset was lowered from cca 30.000 images to 2000 and the number of epochs was lowered from 25 to 10, as even with numbers so low it takes my laptop 5h to train the model.

The end result is thus pretty horrible as I could not have fed it enough images and assign it enough epochs.
but with should I have a GPU available and could train it properly I would only need to re-add the rest of the images and increase the number of epochs (though not above 50 as it would result in overfitting).

#### Summary
I documented everything I found important in the jupyter notebook file with markdown, step by step as I added it in **main.ipynb** file.
